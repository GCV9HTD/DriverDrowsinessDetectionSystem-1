# DriverDrowsinessDetectionSystem
A facial recognition system that tracks the drivers face and detects eye closure and yawn rate. 
In the case a driver is sleepy, the system alerts them with a distinct sound. 
The number of yawns and eye closure are always calculated and used to detect a pattern of drowsiness over time. 
This system was developed on a Linux OS.
